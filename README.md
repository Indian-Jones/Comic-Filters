# Comic-Filters

## Made By
Made by me, Sarabeswaran Balamurugan, but also with the help of filters in filters.svg from [hail2u](https://github.com/hail2u) in [this repo](https://github.com/hail2u/color-blindness-emulation). I used MaterialUI for styling and react-pdf for opening the pdf's.

## Info

This is a simple web app made in create-react-app that applies different color-deficiency filters on pdf's uploaded. It should work with most PDF's, but it was made with comic PDFs in mind. I was able to get these pdf's by using Comixology's manual backup ability.

## Notes
This app works best in full screen browsers.
